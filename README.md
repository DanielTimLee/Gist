# Gist
Alias for Personal Gist repos. Copying from gist every time sucks!


# Package Manager

The main package manager for this [`Gist`](https://github.com/DanielTimLee/Gist) uses [`Pacapt`](https://github.com/icy/pacapt)

At least `bash` and `curl` must be installed before. (`Alpine Linux` or `Ubuntu, openSUSE docker` not installed)

```shell
# Run with Sudo!
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://git.io/vbBdd)"
```
